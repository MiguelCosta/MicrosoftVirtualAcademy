Enterprise Developer Camps Training Kit

Version 1.2.0
February 5, 2014

This training kit shows how to modernize your existing .NET client line of business (LOB) applications for multiple devices. You will learn how to move .NET client LOB applications forward without having to start from scratch with new technologies. You will learn about Microsoft’s devices and services strategy, what it means for you and how your existing applications fit in. You will review best practices for using a services architecture. You will see how and why to move your LOB applications to Windows Azure, how to use 3rd party controls to add a modern look and feel and how to provide your users the ability to use LOB apps on a variety of devices, including Windows 8 and Windows Phone. And you will do all of this using Visual Studio 2013 and your existing XAML skills!

This training kit was built using Visual Studio 2013. If you only have Visual Studio 2012 you can still open the projects in modules 2-4. However, you will need to unload the Expenses.ViewModel.Tests project in the Expenses solution.
